                       openMSX INTERNAL OSD GUI SPANISH TRANSLATION BY DRWH0                      
===========================================================================================================


Until the official release of the new stable release of openMSX I have decided to release my 
PERSONAL AND PROVISIONAL modifications to openMSX that enhances it with these features, those 
changes must be considered as a beta quality:

1.- Translation of the most used functions of internal OSD to Spanish
2.- Added options to the GUI to enable/disable internal firmware switch
3.- Translation of the most important "Toys" and "Tools"
4.- TSX filter for use *ONLY* in the modified version TSXAdvanced from "imulilla"
5.- Added SHIFT+MENU + CTRL+MENU shortcuts to activate/deactivate firmware button of some MSX
6.- Modifications full compatible with MAC/Dingux/Linux/Raspberry/Windows (build 05/13/2020)
7.- Changed the default icon set to of emulator to set 5 (aesthetic enhancement)
8.- Changed internal GUI default colours
9.- Changed text of "menu" item in the upper left corner at startup

TO DO (when next stable version is launched I will start working on it):

1.- Catapult Translation (openMSX's external "frontend")
2.- Translation of the remaining elements (within the main executable)
3.- Translation of the console help text
4.- New custom icon set/skin

Compatibility with the following openMSX versions has been confirmed:

1.- Official version compiled by Fixato/Vampier build 0.15.0-848-g4dbe0355f
2.- TSXAdvanced Fork by imulilla (https://github.com/imulilla/openMSX_TSXadv/releases)
4.- Compatible with 32 and 64 bits environments (files are the same)

===========================================================================================================
                                   KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND ERRORS
===========================================================================================================

1.- Console help text is still in English (that code is inside main executable, so it will be changed in 
    next upcoming stable version)

2.- Catapult is not translated (with the output of next stable version I will add such translation)

3.- Some rare OSD infos are in english (same reason as console help text)

4.- Some functions of the emulator are not working anymore, work incorrectly or has weird behaviour (delete
    "openmsx" folder inside "my documents" before running)

5.- If running under versions below commit "23e23b2" use BETA 001
